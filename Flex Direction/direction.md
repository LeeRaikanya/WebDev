Flex direction can be either row / column / row-rverse / column reverse 

column fits the width of the contents downwards

flex basis is also applied which changes the width of individual elements inside the container 

*if u want to select all children of a parent for css to be applied use the eg .container > * { ..} sign

* the universal selector applies to direct children only
